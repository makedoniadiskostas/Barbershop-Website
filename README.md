# 💈 Barbershop-Website
I’ve been working on a project that I’m really proud of — a website for DissBarbers SKG, a barbershop I designed and developed to showcase services, style, and ease of booking.
The project is now live and almost finished, but still a work in progress! I’ll be continuing to refine the design, add new features, and improve the user experience along the way.
This has been a great opportunity to practice web design, front-end development, and building a smooth, responsive interface.
